in sqlalchemy, there is limitation,
we cant modify tables, its does allow us to make new column, delete columns, add fk contraint

sqlalchemy check the table if table with that same name then it will not create  new table.


for this solution is:-
alembic---- This is Database Migrations

Developers can track changes to code and rollback code easily with git. Why cant we do the same for database models/tables.
Database migrations allow us to incrementally track changes to database schma and rollback changes to any point in time.
We will use a toll called Alembic to makes changes to our database.
Alembic can also automatically pull database models from Sqlachemy and generate the proper tables.
